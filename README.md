# Automated EDA Tool

## Overview

The Automated EDA Tool is a web application designed to simplify exploratory data analysis (EDA) for users. Built using Streamlit, this tool allows users to upload datasets and generate insightful visualizations and analyses with minimal effort. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or student, this tool can help you quickly explore and understand your data.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can easily upload CSV files for analysis.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Generate histograms and boxplots to visualize individual features.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Create scatterplots to understand relationships between two variables.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Visualize correlations between features in the dataset.
- **Missing Values**: Identify and address missing values within the data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Visualize and understand outliers in your dataset.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Interactive and responsive graphs for better insights.

## Technologies Used

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - For building the web application.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For data manipulation and analysis.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - For statistical data visualization.
